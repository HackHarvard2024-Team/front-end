Albatross is a hackathon project designed to demonstrate how AI and real-time crime data can enhance urban safety by calculating the safest routes for navigation. Built with **Vue.js**, this frontend provides an interactive dashboard showcasing routes that avoid high-risk areas. While currently in demo mode, the project was fully functional during the hackathon and can be fully operational again by reactivating the AWS pipeline.

## 🌟 Inspiration

In the journey toward Smart Cities, safety is often sidelined. Many navigation tools prioritize efficiency but fail to consider safety, often leading users into unsafe areas. Albatross seeks to solve this issue by integrating safety into navigation systems, ensuring a smarter, safer travel experience.

## ✨ What It Does

Albatross uses real-time crime data and traffic patterns to:
1. Identify high-risk zones (visualized as polygons).
2. Calculate the safest routes, avoiding these zones.
3. Display the routes and risk zones on an intuitive dashboard.

In its current **demo mode**, the project includes **hardcoded polygons** representing high-risk zones on **W 34th St, NYC** and **E 42nd St, NYC**, simulating the functionality of real-time crime data processing. During the hackathon, the system was fully functional with live data processing via AWS.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
   - Crime data is ingested into a **Databricks Delta Lake** from public datasets or live streams.
   - An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline processes this data:
     - **E**: Extracts raw crime data.
     - **T**: Transforms the data using MLflow to identify and cluster high-crime zones into **N-gon polygons**.
     - **L**: Loads the processed data into the Delta Lake as structured crime hot zones.

2. **Routing and Navigation**:
   - The list of nearby N-gon crime hot zones is sent to **Cloudflare Workers**, which encode this data into lightweight **flexible polylines**.
   - The **HERE Routing API** receives this encoded data and calculates the safest and fastest route, avoiding these high-crime zones.

3. **Frontend Dashboard**:
   - The **Vue.js** frontend visualizes the safest route and overlays it with the N-gon polygons representing high-risk areas.
   - For demonstration purposes, two preloaded polygons (representing W 34th St and E 42nd St) are used instead of live data processing.

> **Note**: While fully operational during the hackathon, the AWS-based pipeline for real-time crime data processing has been disabled due to cost constraints. The system currently operates in demo mode with hardcoded polygons to showcase its intended functionality.
